# Solve an algorithm challenge with given inputs/outputs and/or automated tests
# Sequential Bi-grams
# Given a string of words, create a set of every sequential bi-gram.  Bigrams are two-word combinations of the text, i.e. "Charlie rocks".
 
# Example

# returns
# "Make a"
# "a killer"

# "impression on"
# Etc.

# requirements
# Generates a set of every possible bigram from a string of text
# Keep performance & memory usage in mind
# Include tests
# We prefer Ruby or Python, but you may use any language.
